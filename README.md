# Medical-data-encryption
**Medical Data Encryption Using Hyper-Chaotic Systems**   This project introduces a robust image encryption method combining a 6D hyper-chaotic system and Fibonacci Q-matrix. It ensures high security, efficiency, and resistance to attacks, making it ideal for securing medical images, telemedicine data, and biomedical research.
